#This file allows its internal values to be accessed by Snakefiles, as well as within python scripts called by rules. 


#It's treated as a python dictionary in Snakefiles and python scripts, and must be designated as the configfile by a Snakefile
#to be used by either. 

#This is done in Snakefiles with the declaration:
#configfile: </workdir/relative/path/to/name.yaml>

#which allows it to be called as config in the Snakefile, and snakemake.config in python scripts called by that snakefile. 


#The values stored are:

#1: HDX Timepoints in integer seconds
#2: Filenames corresponding to each timepoint (.RAW, .mzML, or .mzML.gz depending on what you're starting with)
#3: Important parameters which will constrain different functions within the pipeline



#Name for pipeline run:
"run_name": 

#Path to .csv file where each row is a library protein name followed by its sequence

#Use the integer second timepoints as keys and enter all corresponding MS-Data-file filenames in list form (allows for replicates of any/all timepoints):
#0:
#  - <tp0_fn1>
#  - <tp0_fn2>
#10:

#Exclude paths in filenames! 

#If you provide .mzML or .mzML.gz files the pipeline will recognize this and skip upstream jobs to start as far downstream as possible.

#Control parameters for various important functional values in the pipeline, format is <(str) name_of_param>: <value>; value datatype is specific to use within pipeline.
