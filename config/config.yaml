#This file allows its internal values to be accessed by Snakefiles, as well as within python scripts called by rules. 


#It's treated as a python dictionary in Snakefiles and python scripts, and must be designated as the configfile by a Snakefile
#to be used by either. 

#This is done in Snakefiles with the declaration:
#configfile: </workdir/relative/path/to/name.yaml>

#which allows it to be called as config in the Snakefile, and snakemake.config in python scripts called by that snakefile. 


#The values stored are:

#1: HDX Timepoints in integer seconds
#2: Filenames corresponding to each timepoint (.RAW, .mzML, or .mzML.gz depending on what you're starting with)
#3: Important parameters which will constrain different functions within the pipeline
