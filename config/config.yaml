#This file allows its internal values to be accessed by Snakefiles, as well as within python scripts called by rules. 


#It's treated as a python dictionary in Snakefiles and python scripts, and must be designated as the configfile by a Snakefile
#to be used by either. 

#This is done in Snakefiles with the declaration:
#configfile: </workdir/relative/path/to/name.yaml>

#which allows it to be called as config in the Snakefile, and snakemake.config in python scripts called by that snakefile. 


#The values stored are:

#1: HDX Timepoints in integer seconds
#2: Filenames corresponding to each timepoint (.RAW, .mzML, or .mzML.gz depending on what you're starting with)
#3: Important parameters which will constrain different functions within the pipeline



#Name for pipeline run:
"run_name": "210210_Mix1"

#Path to .csv file where each row is a library protein name followed by its sequence
"names_and_seqs": "resources/library_info/GJR_2017_HX_mix1_proc.csv"

#Control parameters for various important functional values in the pipeline, format is <(str) name_of_param>: <value>; value datatype is specific to use within pipeline.

### PREPROCESSING ###
# Determines percentage of max LC peak an LC peak must reach to be included in creation of consensus RT bounds 
"lc_peak_prominence_cutoff": 0.15 
#Sets bounds on how far away a peak can be in LC from others like it and still be processed in a single DataTensor, default is 0.2 mins
"rt_group_cutoff": 0.2 


### Main Snakefile ###

#path to old data for comparison, !!!set to null to make None in python!!! this will be default or removed from full release, requires ending '/' for dir
"old_data_dir": "resources/old_data/fit_noslow/"

#boundaries on tensor size in each dimension (LC-time in decimal minutes, IMS time in ms, M/Z by mass-units)
"rt_radius": 0.4
"dt_radius_scale": 0.06

#the two values below are added to the length of the protein sequence to determine the total_mass_window of a tensor (70 for a protein with 43 resiudes)

#this value creates a margin behind the POI monoisotopic mass to avoid IsotopicCluster truncation

#this value is added to the length of the amino acid sequence to give a 'rightward' margin for readability 
"high_mass_margin": 17 

#error bounds on expected peak positions
"ppm_radius": 30

#Number of factors to use in the Non-Negative_PARAFAC decompositions of all DataTensors, ideally should be = (# of protein signals in DataTensor + 1 factor for noise)
#if n_factors_low = n_factors_high, only the low value is used, otherwise all intervening values are used, including the upper value. 2 - 5 will perform 4 factorizations. 
#use multiple factorizations to get better chances of a good factorization for each tensor. Beware the factorization is computationally intensive, increasing with n_factors
"n_factors_low": 3
