    "# Using HDX_LIMIT Part 2: Extracting Signals and Quality Control\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**The purpose of this notebook is to provide explanation and usage examples for the first half of the HDX_LIMIT.pipeline subpackage: the extract_timepoint_tensors, idotp_check, and idotp_filter modules.**\n",
    "\n",
    ">These modules are responsible for the extraction of relevant signal, the determination of signal quality, and quality-based workflow pruning, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The extract_timepoint_tensors module reads a .mzML.gz file, extracts a region of the 3D data around the center of identified signal for each line in library_info, and writes those extracted tensors to disk and/or returns them in a python dictionary.**\n",
    "\n",
    ">The module relies on .mzML.gz files and library_info.csv from preprocessing, but no other inputs are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    ">extract_timepoint_tensors has the 'indices' argument, which will limit extraction to a subset of library_info if a list of indices is passed. If no indices are passed, all lines in library_info are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The two 'IdotP' modules: idotp_check and idotp_filter, are used in Snakemake to reduce the number of candidate signals to be processed.** \n",
    ">The idotp_check Snakefile extracts signal from all undeuterated replicates for each entry in library_info.csv, uses the core classes to clean and deconvolute the data, and measures the quality of the observed signal against the theoretical isotopic distribution determined from the given protein's sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    ">The measure of quality used is the dot product between the observed and theoretical normalized integrated m/Z distributions (range [0,1]), or 'isotopic dot product' shortened to 'idotp'. A lower threshold on idotp is given to idotp_filter, which returns a set of indices from library_info.csv with idotp >= threshold. Lines in library_info.csv with poor idotp are not considered for further processing, crucially reducing computational load. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Default values for the idotp threshold are ~0.99 for extremely-high-confidence, and ~0.95 for high-confidence. Thresholds should be as close to 1 as possible to avoid excessive load and garbage-in-garbage-out problems, while retaining the highest identification-rate possible. The idotp_filter module creates plots of the idotp distribution, which help in making informed choices about idotp threshold.\n",
